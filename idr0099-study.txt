The ovoidal geometry dictates that the epithelial sheet first expands and subsequently compacts. Moreover, the spreading epithelium is mechanically stressed and this stress needs to be released. We show that during extraembryonic tissue (serosa) epiboly in the insect Tribolium castaneum, the non-proliferative serosa becomes regionalized into a solid-like dorsal region with larger non-rearranging cells, and a more fluid-like ventral region surrounding the leading edge with smaller cells undergoing intercalations. Our results suggest that a heterogeneous actomyosin cable contributes to the fluidization of the leading edge by driving sequential eviction and intercalation of individual cells away from the serosa margin. Since this developmental solution utilized during epiboly resembles the mechanism of wound healing, we propose actomyosin cable-driven local tissue fluidization as a conserved morphogenetic module for closure of epithelial gaps.																	Study Key Words	# Morphogenesis, Lightsheet, Tribolium, Actomyosin, Tissue Fluidisation																												Study Organism	# Tribolium castaneum																															Study Organism Term Source REF	NCBI:txid7070																																Study Organism Term Accession	# leave blank																																Study Experiments Number	# 1																		Study External URL	# Êhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/744193v1																																Study Public Release Date	# enter a date of when the data can be made public, if known																																																																	# Study Publication																																	Study PubMed ID	# fill in if known																																Study Publication Title# Regionalized tissue fluidization is required for epithelial gap closure during insect gastrulation																																Study Author List	# Akanksha Jain, Vladimir Ulman, Arghyadip Mukherjee, Mangal Prakash, Marina B.

The EFA-nGFP transgenic line which ubiquitously expresses a nuclear-localized GFP reporter was used for imaging. Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM), was carried out on a Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 microscope equipped with a 20x/1.0 NA Plan Apochromat water-immersion detection objective and two 10x/0.2 NA dry illumination objectives. The total time interval between two successive timepoints is 90 seconds. Z-stacks were acquired from 3 overlapping views every 120¡ with voxel size 0.33 µm x 0.33 µm x 2.0 µm. Individual views were registered using bead-based registration and then fused to form combined 3D Tiff stacks using the Multiview reconstruction plugin in Fiji.

							Study Title	Regionalized tissue fluidization is required for epithelial gap closure during insect gastrulation										Study Type	time-lapse imaging																					Study Type Term Source REF	OMIT																					Study Type Term Accession	OMIT_0027490																					Study Description	Many animal embryos pull and close an epithelial sheet around the ellipsoidal egg surface during a gastrulation process known as epiboly. The ovoidal geometry dictates that the epithelial sheet first expands and subsequently compacts. Moreover, the spreading epithelium is mechanically stressed and this stress needs to be released. We show that during extraembryonic tissue (serosa) epiboly in the insect Tribolium castaneum, the non-proliferative serosa becomes regionalized into a solid-like dorsal region with larger non-rearranging cells, and a more fluid-like ventral region surrounding the leading edge with smaller cells undergoing intercalations. Our results suggest that a heterogeneous actomyosin cable contributes to the fluidization of the leading edge by driving sequential eviction and intercalation of individual cells away from the serosa margin. Since this developmental solution utilized during epiboly resembles the mechanism of wound healing, we propose actomyosin cable-driven local tissue fluidization as a conserved morphogenetic module for closure of epithelial gaps.																	Study Key Words	Morphogenesis	Lightsheet	Tribolium	Actomyosin	Tissue Fluidisation

Experiment Sample Type	tissue																															Experiment Description	This dataset contains multiview fused images of Tribolium castaneum embryos labelled with a uniform nuclear localized eGFP signal, a uniform Histone-eGFP signal, a uniform LifeAct-eGFP signal, a uniform Tc-Squash-eGFP signal and a Gap43-eYFP signal. Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM), was carried out on a Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 microscope equipped with a 20x/1.0 NA Plan Apochromat water-immersion detection objective and two 10x/0.2 NA dry illumination objectives. Individual views were registered using bead-based registration and then fused to form combined 3D Tiff stacks using the Multiview reconstruction plugin in Fiji. 																				Experiment Size	5D Images: 	Average Image Dimension (XYZCT): 0.38 µm,0.38 µm, 0.38 µm, 1, 798.
